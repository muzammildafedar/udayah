## Setting Up the Project Locally


To set up Udayah for local development, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Install Flutter version **3.19** by following the [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
- Set up your own Firebase instance and link it to the project for in-app account creation for now.

- for web check out [Flutter Web documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building)


### Clone this repository:

```git clone https://github.com/your-username/udayah.git```

- cd udayah

- Then navigate to the `lib/` folder within the Flutter project to begin development.

   ``` flutter run -d chrome```


### Backend Setup
Navigate to the Backend Directory

- Go to the functions/ folder, which contains the backend code for Udayah.
- Install Dependencies
  ``` npm install ```
- Configure Environment Variables

Copy the ```.env.example``` file and rename it to ```.env``` in the functions/ directory.

- Set the following environment variables in the .env file:
- ```ENCRYPTION_KEY:``` This should match the encryption key used in the Flutter application.
- Database settings as required.

Start the Server

```npm start```


### Encryption Setup

In the Flutter project, go to `lib/encryption.dart` and ensure that the encryption key matches the one defined in your `.env` file in the Node.js backend. The key can be set like this in Flutter:

```dart
static final key = encrypt.Key.fromUtf8("your key"); // Ensure this is the same as in Node.js
```
### Update Flutter API Endpoint

In the Flutter project, navigate to `lib/data/constant.dart` and update the backend API endpoint to match your local or hosted server.

## Submitting a Pull Request

- Fork the repository and create a new branch from ```main```.
- Add and **commit** your changes with clear messages.
- Ensure your code follows the projectâ€™s code style and passes any existing tests.
